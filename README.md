# symbol-recognizing-neural-network
I know the README should explain the code or the project but I would like to refer you to someone who can do it even better.
I wrote this code following the book that i read called "Make you own Neural Network" which is described as:
"A gentle journey through the mathematics of neural networks, and making your own using the Python computer language. Neural networks are a key element of deep learning and artificial intelligence, which today is capable of some truly impressive feats."

this book is truly amazing and explains, I have tried to read alot of books regarding this topic but this book striked me in a different manner, Mr Tariq Rashid explains concepts and proofs in a very down to earth way, i can say for sure after treading it i can implement what i read in real world situations. 
I still keep it to use as reference to remind me of the basics of making neural nets.
It is the perfect marraige of simplicity and information
